# Yul_ERC20

This project is an implementation of the ERC20 token standard using inline assembly Yul.
This project serves as a great resource to explore inline assembly and learn about the basics of it. It encompasses multiple Yul implementations, consolidating various aspects that would otherwise take several projects to cover.

## Tip:
A great way to learn Yul is to just play around with the storage and memory of a contract.
